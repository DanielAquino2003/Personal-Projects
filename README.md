# My Personal Lobby

Welcome to my Personal Lobby!

[Lobby Access](https://lobby-ccm2.onrender.com)

This website has been designed to be my organizational hub at university, where I can manage my tasks, exams, and quickly access the tools I frequently use. Here you'll find an intuitive and functional interface to keep me up to date with my academic responsibilities and optimize my productivity.

## Features

- **Task Management**: I can easily create, edit, and delete tasks, assigning them due dates and priorities to keep myself organized.

- **Exam Calendar**: I have the ability to record my important exams and receive reminders to prepare adequately.

- **Direct Access to Tools**: Direct shortcuts to essential tools I use in my studies have been integrated, facilitating my access to them without wasting time.

## Future Functionalities

I'm constantly working on improving my Personal Lobby to make it even more useful and efficient. Some features I plan to implement soon include:

- **Customization Options**: Adding the possibility of customization so that anyone can make use of this tool.

- **Utilizing More Efficient Technologies for Web Application Development**.

- **Custom Reminders**: The ability to set custom reminders for important events and deadlines.

- **Integration with External Calendars**: Allowing the import and synchronization of events with external calendars such as Google Calendar.

- **Progress Tracking**: Implementing tools to track the progress in my tasks and academic goals.

This project has been developed using the following technologies:

- HTML5

## How to Use
